### Overview
When faced with the challenge of splitting gas costs among six individuals sharing a car, I developed a web application that streamlined the process of dividing ride expenses. My roommate recently bought a car, and with a group of six friends, he would offer rides. However, manually splitting the fuel costs every time became cumbersome. This served as the primary motivation for creating this application, as it greatly streamlined the process, and all expenses were automatically recorded in the database for easy tracking of rides.

### Features

* User authentication for secure cost tracking
